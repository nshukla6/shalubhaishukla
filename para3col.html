			<h2>Tobacco in Indian Economy</h2>
			<p>In India, tobacco is grown on 0.45 M ha of area (accounting for only 0.31% of net cultivated area in the country) with 750 M kg production. The world tobacco production is ~7 billion kg, China occupying the first place with 2.35 billion kg. There are ten distinct tobacco types grown in 15 states of the country which include cigarette (FCV, burley, Oriental) and non-cigarette types (Bidi, chewing, hookah, natu, cheroot, cigar and HDBRG). India stands second in tobacco production and exports in the world. Tobacco earns annually Rs 4,402 crores as foreign exchange and Rs 13,853 crores as excise revenue. Its total contribution to the national economy is Rs 18,255 crores. In India, the tobacco crop directly or indirectly supports ~36 million people engaged in production, processing, marketing and exports which includes six million farmers and 5 million people involved in bidi-rolling and tendu leaf-plucking. Thus, the crop is a lifeline for sizeable chunk of population, particularly rural women, tribals and other weaker sections of the society.</p>
